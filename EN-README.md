## 1.	System Specification

### Task
The Dungeons of the Galaxy project is a 2D dungeon crawl game that immerses users in a fantasy role-playing experience. Initially, the demo version features a hero controlled by the player, who must navigate a trap-filled, labyrinth-like map while fighting monsters â€” the enemies present on each level. Later on, the entertainment experience will be enhanced with local CO-OP functionality, three different maps with distinct visuals and difficulty levels, and a task system.

### Development Tools
Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, Blender, Paint 3D

### Environment
Windows 10, C#, Unity Engine


## 2.	Requirements Specification

### Description of the Current Situation
	In today's modern world, people use their phones, laptops, or desktop computers on a daily basis. These devices have become the primary means for stress relief and entertainment. Games not only provide fun but also help develop hand-eye coordination, problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and multitasking abilities. Moreover, CO-OP video games offer an easier way to build social connections.

### Vision for the Desired System
	The goal is to develop a 2D local CO-OP dungeon crawl game. Users can progress to higher levels by completing various tasks. The task system includes combat with enemies tailored to each map. At the end of the first three maps, the user will face minibosses, and a main boss on the fourth level. Additionally, a few hidden superbosses are also placed throughout the game to challenge the player further.

### Required Business Processes
	The game aims to provide entertainment for anyone interested in 2D dungeon games. The local CO-OP feature also caters to players seeking two-player experiences, thereby expanding the potential user base.

### Requirement List
	The game requires a platform such as a laptop or desktop computer. Recommended operating system is Windows 10, but Windows 7 and Windows 11 are also compatible. Minimum requirements: CPU: x86/x64 architecture with SSE2 instruction set support + GPU: DX10-capable or higher. It is also recommended to install and/or update officially supported drivers from the hardware manufacturer. Both mouse and keyboard are required.
